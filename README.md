 This robot was designed to compete in the [frc game REEFSCAPE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWbxcjlY9JY). Our robot can do almost all aspects of the game including Score Coral (L1-L4), Score Algae in the processor, Score Algae in the barge, pick up coral and algea from the ground, pick up coral form the source, descore and pick up algae from the reef, and climb on the deep cage. This robot is being built and we have made considerable progress. you can go to [our chief delhpi thread](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/8738-slice-2025-open-alliance-build-thread/476432) and follow along with our season on there!
